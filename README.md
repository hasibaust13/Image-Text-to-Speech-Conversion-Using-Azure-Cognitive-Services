Multimedia System Project 

Description: In this project, we intend to tackle a problem that no other standard approach has addressed: training a facial recognition model with group images of multiple faces without a clear face rectangle. The captured image undergoes a series of image pre-processing steps to locate only that part of the image that contains the text. Lastly, We convert the text of images into speech. The whole procedure of our project is conducted using Azure Cognitive Services in serverless architecture.
